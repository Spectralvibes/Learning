# Differentiate between Components and Directives in Angular.
  - **Components** break up the application into smaller parts.
  - **Directives** add behavior to an existing DOM element.

# What are directives? What are different types of directives?



# What is RxJS? What are RxJS subjects, operators?
RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables. 

References:
- [Subjects](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/subjects)
- [Operators](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators)


# What is an observable?
Observables provide support for data sharing between publishers and subscribers in an angular application. It is referred to as a better technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values as compared to techniques like promises.
Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS.

The observables are created using new keyword. Let see the simple example of observable,
```javascript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(observer => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');
	}, 2000);
});
```


# Subject vs BehaviourSubject
[Read](https://devsuhas.com/2019/12/09/difference-between-subject-and-behaviour-subject-in-rxjs/)


# What is viewChild and viewChildren?


# What is the difference between promise and observable?
- Observables are Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription; so that they can be run whenever you need the result.
- Promise Execute immediately on creation
- Observables Provide multiple values over time, Promise Provide only one
- Observables Subscribe method is used for error handling which makes centralized and predictable error handling	
- Promise Push errors to the child promises
- Observables Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications	
- Promise Uses only .then() clause


# What are the utility functions provided by RxJS?
The RxJS library also provides below utility functions for creating and working with observables.
- Converting existing code for async operations into observables
- Iterating through the values in a stream
- Mapping values to different types
- Filtering streams
- Composing multiple streams

- map() : Used to map values of different data types.
- filter() : Used for filtering streams.
- concat() : Used to concatenate multiple strings.
- merge(): Used to recursively descend into object properties in the source copy, while forming a deep copy of the same.


# What are web workers?
Web workers enables JavaScript application to run the CPU-intensive tasks in the background so that the application main thread concentrate on the smooth operation of UI. Angular provides support for including Web workers in the application.



# What are components?
- A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.
- A class with the @Component() decorator that associates it with a companion template. 
- Together, the component and template define a view. 
- A component is a special type of directive. 
- The @Component() decorator extends the @Directive() decorator with template-oriented features.
	

# What is a module?
NgModules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. The application is divided into separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.

# What is Redux? 
- It is a library which helps us maintain the state of the application. 
- Redux is not required in applications that are simple with the simple data flow, 
- it is used in Single Page Applications that have complex data flow. 
## What Is Flux?
Flux is a data flow architecture created by Facebook back in 2014. 

# What is Data Binding? How many ways it can be done?
- Event Binding:
Enables the application to respond to user input in the target environment
Syntax: 
```javascript
(target)="statement"		
on-target="statement" 
```
- Property Binding:
Enables interpolation of values computed from application data into the HTML
Syntax:
```javascript
{{expression}}
[target]="expression"
bind-target="expression"
```
Type: 		Interpolation, Property, Attribute, Class, Style
- Two-way Binding:
Changes made in the application state gets automatically reflected in the view and vice-versa. The ngModel directive is used for achieving this type of data binding.
Syntax:
```javascript
[(target)]="expression"
bindon-target="expression"
```
Type: Two-way


# Angular architecture overview


# What is ViewEncapsulation and how many ways are there do to do it in Angular?
To put simply, ViewEncapsulation determines whether the styles defined in a particular component will affect the entire application or not. Angular supports 3 types of ViewEncapsulation:
- Emulated: Styles used in other HTML spread to the component
- Native: Styles used in other HTML doesn't spread to the component
- None: Styles defined in a component are visible to all components of the application


# What is ng-template, ng-container, ng-content directive?
 - **`<ng-template>`**: As the name suggests the `<ng-template>` is a template element that Angular uses with structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [ngSwitch] and custom directives).
- **`<ng-container>`**: The Angular `<ng-container>` is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.
- **`<ng-content>`**: You use the `<ng-content></ng-content>` tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content. Think of it like curly brace interpolation, but on a bigger scale. The technical term for this is "content projection" because you are projecting content from the parent component into the designated child component.

# What does a Subscribe method do in Angular?
It is a method which is subscribed to an observable. Whenever the subscribe method is called, an independent execution of the observable happens.


# What is an AsyncPipe in Angular? What is the purpose of async pipe?
When an observable or promise returns something, we use a temporary property to hold the content. Later, we bind the same content to the template. 
With the usage of AsyncPipe, the promise or observable can be directly used in a template and a temporary property is not required.
- **Purpose**: The AsyncPipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new value is emitted, the pipe marks the component to be checked for changes.


# Angular design pattern


# What is metadata?
Metadata is used to decorate a class so that it can configure the expected behavior of the class. The metadata is represented by decorators.
- Class decorators, e.g. @Component and @NgModule
- Property decorators Used for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output
- Method decorators Used for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener
- Parameter decorators Used for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject


# Decorators,  Annotations


# What is Angular CLI? CLI commands?
Angular CLI(Command Line Interface) is a command line interface to scaffold and build angular apps using nodejs style (commonJs) modules.


# What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?
- TypeScript classes has a default method called constructor which is normally used for the initialization purpose. 
- Whereas ngOnInit method is specific to Angular, especially used to define Angular bindings. 
- Even though constructor getting called first, it is preferred to move all of your Angular bindings to ngOnInit method.


# What is a service?
A service is used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components.
- @Injectable decorator converts a plain Typescript class into Angular service:
```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 
@Injectable({ 
   providedIn: 'root',  // providedIn?: Type<any> | 'root' | 'platform' | 'any' | null
})
export class DebugService { 
   constructor() { } 
}
```
- providedIn: Determines which injectors will provide the injectable, by either associating it with an @NgModule or other InjectorType, or by specifying that this injectable should be provided in one of the following injectors:
	- 'root' : The application-level injector in most apps.
	- 'platform' : A special singleton platform injector shared by all applications on the page.
	- 'any' : Provides a unique instance in each lazy loaded module while all eagerly loaded modules share one instance.
- [Dependency Injection in Action](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-in-action)


# What is dependency injection in Angular?
Dependency injection (DI), is an important application design pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. 
Angular comes with its own dependency injection framework for resolving dependencies( services or objects that a class needs to perform its function).
So you can have your services depend on other services throughout your application.


# How is Dependency Hierarchy formed?/ How dependency injection works?



# What is the option to choose between inline and external template file?
The choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste, circumstances, and organization policy. But normally we use inline template for small portion of code and external template file for bigger views. By default, the Angular CLI generates components with a template file. But you can override that with the below command, ng generate component hero -it


# What happens if you use script tag inside template?
Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the script tag. This way it eliminates the risk of script injection attacks. If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.


# What is interpolation?
Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into property binding.


# What are template expressions?
- A template expression produces a value similar to any Javascript expression. 
- Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive. 
- In the property binding, a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in [property]="expression". 
- In interpolation syntax, the template expression is surrounded by double curly braces. 
- The below javascript expressions are prohibited in template expression
	- assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)
	- new
	- chaining expressions with ; or ,
	- increment and decrement operators (++ and --)


# What are template statements?
- A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. 
- The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like (event)="statement".
- In the above expression, editProfile is a template statement. The below JavaScript syntax expressions are not allowed.
	- new
	- increment and decrement operators, ++ and --
	- operator assignment, such as += and -=
	- the bitwise operators | and &
	- the template expression operators


# What are pipes?
A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output.


# What is a parameterized pipe?
- A pipe can accept any number of optional parameters to fine-tune its output. 
- The parameterized pipe can be created by declaring the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value. 
- If the pipe accepts multiple parameters, separate the values with colons.
>Note: The parameter value can be any valid template expression, such as a string literal or a component property.


# What is a custom pipe?
Apart from built-inn pipes, you can write your own custom pipe with the below key characteristics:
A pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata @Pipe decorator, which you import from the core Angular library For example,
```javascript
	@Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'})
```
The pipe class implements the PipeTransform interface's transform method that accepts an input value followed by optional parameters and returns the transformed value. The structure of pipeTransform would be as below,
```javascript
interface PipeTransform {
	transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any
}
```
You can create custom reusable pipes for the transformation of existing value. 
For example, let us create a custom pipe for finding file size based on an extension,
```javascript
		import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';
		
		@Pipe({name: 'customFileSizePipe'})
		export class FileSizePipe implements PipeTransform {
		  transform(size: number, extension: string = 'MB'): string {
			return (size / (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2) + extension;
		  }
		}
```
Now you can use the above pipe in template expression as below,
	 template: `
		<p>Size: {{288966 | customFileSizePipe: 'GB'}}</p>
	  `


# What is the difference between pure and impure pipe?
- A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. 
- For example, any changes to a primitive input value (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol) or a changed object reference (Date, Array, Function, Object). 
- An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters changes. i.e, An impure pipe is called often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move.


# What is a bootstrapping module?
Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module.


# What is HttpClient and its benefits?
Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API. 
- Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as HttpClient which is based on top of XMLHttpRequest interface.
- The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,
	- Contains testability features
	- Provides typed request and response objects
	- Intercept request and response
	- Supports Observalbe APIs
	- Supports streamlined error handling
Below are the steps need to be followed for the usage of HttpClient.
	- Import HttpClient into root module
	- Inject the HttpClient into the application
```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
const userProfileUrl: string = 'assets/data/profile.json';
@Injectable()
export class UserProfileService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
}
getUserProfile() {
  return this.http.get(this.userProfileUrl);
}
```
- Create a component for subscribing service: Let's create a component called UserProfileComponent(userprofile.component.ts) which inject UserProfileService and invokes the service method,
```javascript
fetchUserProfile() {
  this.userProfileService.getUserProfile()
	.subscribe((data: User) => this.user = {
		id: data['userId'],
		name: data['firstName'],
		city:  data['city']
	});
}
```
Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component.


# How can you read full response?
The response body doesn't may not return full response data because sometimes servers also return special headers or status code which which are important for the application workflow. Inorder to get full response, you should use observe option from HttpClient,
```javascript
getUserResponse(): Observable<HttpResponse<User>> {
  return this.http.get<User>(
	this.userUrl, { observe: 'response' });
}
```
Now HttpClient.get() method returns an Observable of typed HttpResponse rather than just the JSON data.


# How do you perform Error handling?


# What will happen if you do not supply handler for observer?
Normally an observer object can define any combination of next, error and complete notification type handlers. If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer just ignores notifications of that type.


# What are angular elements?
- Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements(a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way). 
- Angular Elements hosts an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and logic defined in the component and standard DOM APIs, thus, providing a way to use Angular components in non-Angular environments.


# What is progressive web app PWA?
Progressive web apps (PWA) are normal web application with few enhancements and behaves like a native application. PWA apps does not depends on network to work. PWA caches the application and renders it from local cache. It regularly checks the live version of the application and then caches the latest version in the background.
## Service worker
At its simplest, a service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application.

Service workers function as a network proxy. They intercept all outgoing HTTP requests made by the application and can choose how to respond to them. For example, they can query a local cache and deliver a cached response if one is available. Proxying isn't limited to requests made through programmatic APIs, such as fetch; it also includes resources referenced in HTML and even the initial request to index.html. Service worker-based caching is thus completely programmable and doesn't rely on server-specified caching headers.

# What is subscribing?

An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it. 
So you need to subscribe by calling the subscribe() method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications. 

Let's take an example of creating and subscribing to a simple observable, with an observer that logs the received message to the console.
Creates an observable sequence of 5 integers, starting from 1
```javascript
const source = range(1, 3);
		
// Create observer object
const myObserver = {
	next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
	error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
	complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
};

// Execute with the observer object and Prints out each item
myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);
// => Observer got a next value: 1
// => Observer got a next value: 2
// => Observer got a next value: 3
// => Observer got a complete notification
```


# Internationalization (i18n)


# Accessibility
Accessibility support is one of the important feature of every UI based application. Accessibility is a way of designing the application so that, it is accessible for those having certain disabilities as well. Let us learn the support provided by Angular to develop application with good accessibility.
- While using attribute binding, use attr. prefix for ARIA attributes.
- Use Angular material component for Accessibility. Some of the useful components are LiveAnnouncer and cdkTrapFocu.
- Use native HTML elements wherever possible because native HTML element provides maximum accessibility features. When creating a component, select native html element matching your use case instead of redeveloping the native functionality.
- Use NavigationEnd to track and control the focus of the application as it greatly helps in accessibility.


# Server Side Rendering
Server side Rendering (SSR) is a modern technique to convert a Single Page Application (SPA) running in the browser into a server based application. Usually, in SPA, the server returns a simple index.html file with the reference to the JavaScript based SPA app. The SPA app take over from there, configure the entire application, process the request and then send the final response.

But in SSR supported application, the server as well do all the necessary configuration and then send the final response to the browser. The browser renders the response and start the SPA app. SPA app takeover from there and further request are diverted to SPA app. The flow of SPA and SSR is as shown in below diagram.


# What is an observer?
Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable. It has below structure,
```javascript
interface Observer<T> {
	closed?: boolean;
	next: (value: T) => void;
	error: (err: any) => void;
	complete: () => void;
}
```
A handler that implements the Observer interface for receiving observable notifications will be passed as a parameter for observable as below,
```javascript
myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);
```
> Note: If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type.


# What is multicasting?
Multi-casting is the practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution. Let's demonstrate the multi-casting feature,

```javascript
var source = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);
var subject = new Rx.Subject();
var multicasted = source.multicast(subject);

// These are, under the hood, `subject.subscribe({...})`:
multicasted.subscribe({
	next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
multicasted.subscribe({
	next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});
// This is, under the hood, `s
```
 
	
# How do you perform error handling in observables?
You can handle errors by specifying an error callback on the observer instead of relying on try/catch which are ineffective in asynchronous environment. 
Example, you can define error callback as below:
```javascript
myObservable.subscribe({
	next(num) { console.log('Next num: ' + num)},
	error(err) { console.log('Received an errror: ' + err)}
});
```


# What is the short hand notation for subscribe method?
The subscribe() method can accept callback function definitions in line, for next, error, and complete handlers is known as short hand notation or Subscribe method with positional arguments. For example, you can define subscribe method as below:
```javascript
myObservable.subscribe(
	x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
	err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
	() => console.log('Observer got a complete notification')
);
```


# What are observable creation functions?
RxJS provides creation functions for the process of creating observables from things such as promises, events, timers and Ajax requests. Let us explain each of them with an example:

Create an observable from a promise
```javascript
import { from } from 'rxjs'; // from function
const data = from(fetch('/api/endpoint')); //Created from Promise
data.subscribe({
	next(response) { console.log(response); },
	error(err) { console.error('Error: ' + err); },
	complete() { console.log('Completed'); }
});
```
Create an observable that creates an AJAX request
```javascript
import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax'; // ajax function
const apiData = ajax('/api/data'); // Created from AJAX request
// Subscribe to create the request
apiData.subscribe(res => console.log(res.status, res.response));
```
Create an observable from a counter
```javascript
import { interval } from 'rxjs'; // interval function
const secondsCounter = interval(1000); // Created from Counter value
secondsCounter.subscribe(n =>
console.log(`Counter value: ${n}`));
```

# How is SPA (Single Page Application) technology different from the traditional web technology?


# Differentiate between ng-Class and ng-Style.
