# What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?
# What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
- Normalize. css is mainly a set of styles, based on what its author thought would look good, and make it look consistent across browsers. - - Reset basically strips styling from elements so you have more control over the styling of everything.


# Describe Floats and how they work.
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

-left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
