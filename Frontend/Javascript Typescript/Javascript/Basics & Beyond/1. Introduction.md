# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions.

#### <u>Asides:</u>
##### What exactly Just in time (JIT) compilation is in JavaScript?

* Compiler:
A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution, generating an executable file.
    * slower development process due to the need for compilation and recompilation after code changes 
    * a more challenging debugging process due to the generated machine code being less readable
* Interpreter:
An interpreter, on the other hand, executes the code line by line, converting each line into machine code as it's being run.

* <b>The V8 engine</b>: is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used in Chrome, Node.js, and other applications. V8 compiles JavaScript code directly to machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which significantly improves performance compared to traditional interpreters. 
V8's architecture includes:
    * Parser: Converts JavaScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    * Ignition (Interpreter): Converts AST into bytecode and starts executing it.
    * Compiler: Transforms the AST into bytecode or machine code. V8 uses two JIT compilers:
        * TurboFan: Optimizes frequently executed code and compiles it into machine code. 
        * Sparkplug: Sparkplug compiles bytecode to baseline (Non optimized) machine code quickly, without waiting for profiling data.
    * Runtime System: Provides the necessary environment for executing code, including memory management and garbage collection.

V8 supports ECMAScript and WebAssembly and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, or ARM processors. It can be embedded into any C++ application.
