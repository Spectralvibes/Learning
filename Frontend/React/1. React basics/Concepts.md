### Basics
<details>
<summary>What is React?</summary>

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).
- React is used to build Single Page Applications.
- React is maintained by Meta and a community of developers, and is widely used for web and mobile application development.
- Main features:
    - Reusable UI components
    - Effective State Management
    - Optimized performance through techniques like the virtual DOM
    - Declarative: React uses a declarative approach, meaning developers describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the rendering and updating. 
    - JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code, making it easier to define UI components.
